# BINARY TREES

## Basics

#### Binary Tree define
- data is heirarchical data structure 
- a node can have a max of 2 children

- root : starting point of the binary tree on top level
- children : nodes attatch to any other node
- parent : node having children 
- leaf node : any node which has 0 child
- subtree : extracted part or portion of tree


#### Binary Tree Types
1. Binary Tree
2. Binary Search Tree
3. N-array Tree
4. Full Binary Tree : all nodes must have 2 or 0 children
5. Complete Binary Tree : 
 - All levels must be completely filled except the last level
 - the last level has all nodes in left as possible
6. Perfect Binary Tree : all leaf nodes are at the same level , all non leaf nodes must have 2 children.
7. Balanced Binary Tree : height difference between left and right subtree at any noode must be at max 1.
